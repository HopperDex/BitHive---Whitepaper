# BTT Business Model

## Introduction: Redefining Healthcare Economics

The BTT business model represents a fundamental reimagining of healthcare economics, specifically within the oral healthcare sector. By leveraging the powerful combination of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and decentralized physical infrastructure, BTT creates a sustainable economic framework that aligns the interests of all participants while addressing critical inefficiencies in traditional healthcare delivery and financing models.

At its core, BTT transforms five key healthcare challenges into opportunities:

1. The prohibitive cost and inefficient utilization of advanced AI computational resources
2. The illiquidity of valuable healthcare assets and infrastructure
3. The misalignment of economic incentives for preventive care
4. The friction and inefficiency in healthcare payments
5. The fragmentation of patient data across healthcare providers

Through an integrated approach that combines DePIN mining infrastructure, RWA tokenization, healthcare incentive systems, and streamlined payment solutions, BTT creates a circular economy where value flows freely between participants while ensuring that beneficial behaviors are appropriately rewarded throughout the ecosystem.

## Core Value Proposition

BTT's business model delivers distinct but complementary value to each participant group in the healthcare ecosystem, creating powerful network effects that strengthen as the platform grows.

For oral healthcare providers, BTT significantly reduces the capital expenses associated with advanced AI diagnostic systems by transforming them from fixed costs to variable, usage-based expenditures. This democratizes access to cutting-edge AI capabilities, allowing even small and medium-sized practices to leverage sophisticated diagnostic tools without prohibitive upfront investments. Additionally, BTT's tokenization framework enables these providers to unlock liquidity from traditionally illiquid assets—equipment, property, intellectual property, and service rights—creating new capital formation opportunities without traditional financing constraints.

For compute contributors, BTT transforms excess computational capacity into productive assets that generate ongoing returns. Individual contributors can deploy home-scale mining nodes that earn BTT tokens proportional to their computational contributions, while larger institutional contributors can allocate significant resources to support more complex healthcare AI applications. This distributed computational network creates a true sharing economy for healthcare AI resources, optimizing utilization and reducing waste throughout the system.

For patients, BTT fundamentally transforms the economic experience of healthcare through three complementary mechanisms. First, the incentive system rewards preventive care behaviors, treatment adherence, and healthy lifestyle choices with BTT points that have real economic value. Second, the PayFi payment network reduces transaction costs and accelerates settlement timelines, making healthcare more financially accessible. Third, the tokenization of healthcare assets enables patients to participate in fractional ownership of healthcare infrastructure, creating investment opportunities previously reserved for institutional investors.

For the broader healthcare ecosystem, BTT's business model drives substantial efficiency improvements by creating price discovery mechanisms for computational resources, establishing valuation frameworks for tokenized healthcare assets, and reducing friction in payment processes. These efficiency gains translate directly to reduced costs and improved access throughout the healthcare system.

## Revenue Streams and Economic Model

BTT's business model integrates multiple complementary revenue streams that collectively ensure sustainable economic growth while delivering value to all ecosystem participants. This multi-faceted approach differentiates BTT from more narrowly focused blockchain healthcare initiatives and provides resilience against market fluctuations in any single revenue category.

### Computational Resource Marketplace

The BTT computational marketplace operates on a resource consumption model where healthcare providers pay for AI computational resources based on actual usage. The pricing structure incorporates multiple variables including computational intensity, urgency, data volume, and specialized hardware requirements. This consumption-based model typically results in 60-80% cost savings for healthcare providers compared to maintaining dedicated AI infrastructure or using centralized cloud providers.

From the generated revenue, approximately 70% is distributed to compute contributors based on their resource provision, 15% is allocated to the BTT development fund for ongoing platform improvements, 10% is directed to the BTT Foundation to support ecosystem expansion, and 5% is retained as operational reserves. This distribution ensures that the majority of value flows directly to those providing the fundamental infrastructure while maintaining resources for continuous ecosystem development.

The computational marketplace has demonstrated robust growth since deployment, with monthly transaction volume increasing from ¥5 million in early 2025 to over ¥35 million by Q2 2025. Current projections indicate this volume will exceed ¥100 million monthly by the end of 2026 as more healthcare providers integrate BTT's AI capabilities into their diagnostic workflows.

### Asset Tokenization Platform

The asset tokenization platform generates revenue through a multi-tier fee structure that balances accessibility with sustainability. Initial tokenization of healthcare assets incurs a one-time minting fee ranging from 1-3% based on asset complexity, regulatory requirements, and valuation needs. Secondary market transactions on the BTT exchange generate transaction fees of 0.5-1.0%, significantly lower than traditional asset transfer costs in healthcare that often range from 3-7%.

Additional revenue streams include periodic revaluation services for tokenized assets (0.25-0.5% of asset value), enhanced liquidity pool management for institutional token holders (1-2% annual management fee), and premium listing services for high-value healthcare assets seeking broader investor visibility.

The asset tokenization platform has already facilitated the tokenization of over ¥200 million in healthcare assets during its initial six months, with projections indicating this will surpass ¥1 billion by mid-2026 as more healthcare providers recognize the capital efficiency improvements offered by tokenization.

### Patient Incentive and Rewards System

The patient incentive system incorporates multiple revenue mechanisms that align economic incentives with improved health outcomes. Healthcare providers pay subscription fees ranging from ¥3,000-25,000 monthly (based on practice size) for access to the full BTT patient engagement platform, which demonstrably improves patient retention rates by 22-35% across participating practices.

Commercial partners offering health-related products and services pay placement and redemption fees when patients use BTT points within their ecosystems, creating a robust commercial network that enhances the utility of earned points. Insurance providers increasingly offer premium discounts for patients demonstrating consistent engagement with the BTT health incentive system, with a portion of realized savings flowing back to the BTT ecosystem.

Data from the first two quarters of operation shows that participating practices experience an average 27% increase in preventive care visits and a 31% improvement in treatment plan completion, translating directly to improved practice economics and patient outcomes.

### PayFi Payment Network

The PayFi payment network generates revenue through a streamlined fee structure that significantly undercuts traditional healthcare payment processing while delivering enhanced functionality. Standard transaction fees range from 0.5-0.8% compared to industry averages of 2.5-3.5%, with healthcare providers receiving payments in 1-2 hours rather than the traditional 2-5 day settlement period.

Additional revenue sources include currency conversion fees for international payments (0.75% vs. traditional 3-4%), subscription fees for enhanced payment analytics and reconciliation services, and strategic partnership fees from payment networks seeking access to the growing BTT ecosystem.

The payment network currently processes over ¥30 million in monthly healthcare transactions, with month-over-month growth averaging 12% as more providers adopt the system for its compelling combination of lower fees and accelerated settlement.

The table below summarizes BTT's diversified revenue streams and their relative contribution to the ecosystem's economic sustainability:

| Revenue Stream | Primary Sources | Current Monthly Volume | Projected Growth (2026) | Ecosystem Contribution |

## Market Strategy and Implementation

BTT's market strategy centers on addressing specific pain points within the oral healthcare sector while creating a flexible framework that can extend to broader healthcare applications over time. This targeted approach acknowledges the complexity of healthcare ecosystems while creating clear paths to adoption and value creation.

### Initial Market Focus: Oral Healthcare AI

BTT begins with a deliberate focus on oral healthcare AI applications, specifically targeting diagnostic imaging analysis, treatment planning, and patient engagement within dental practices. This focused approach provides several strategic advantages:

Oral healthcare represents an ideal entry point for healthcare blockchain implementation due to its relatively lower regulatory complexity compared to other medical specialties, higher proportion of direct patient payments (reducing insurance integration challenges), and significant unmet need for affordable AI diagnostic support. The high visual nature of dental diagnostics creates immediate value opportunities for AI applications, with panoramic radiographs, intraoral images, and 3D scans all benefiting from computational analysis.

Current market research indicates that over 85% of dental practices in China's tier-one cities express interest in AI diagnostic support, but less than 12% have implemented solutions due to prohibitive costs and infrastructure requirements. BTT's decentralized computing model directly addresses these barriers by reducing upfront investment requirements and creating flexible usage models tailored to practice needs.

### Scalable Implementation Approach

Rather than attempting simultaneous deployment across all potential use cases, BTT employs a phased implementation strategy that builds credibility and adoption through demonstrated success in targeted applications:

Phase 1 (Current): Panoramic image analysis applications optimized for caries detection and preliminary orthodontic assessment. These applications deliver immediate clinical value with relatively low computational requirements, making them ideal for initial deployment across the network. Current data from pilot implementations shows average diagnostic time savings of 7.5 minutes per patient and 23% improvement in early condition detection.

Phase 2 (2025-2026): Expansion to comprehensive treatment planning tools incorporating 3D modeling, occlusion analysis, and treatment simulation capabilities. These applications require greater computational resources but deliver higher value to practitioners through improved treatment outcomes and increased case acceptance rates, justifying greater resource allocation from the network.

Phase 3 (2026-2027): Integration of longitudinal patient data analysis, preventive care optimization, and practice management optimization using comprehensive data integration across patient records, operational systems, and financial platforms. This phase leverages the established infrastructure to create higher-order applications that transform practice economics beyond individual diagnostic improvements.

Phase 4 (2027+): Expansion beyond oral healthcare to adjacent medical specialties with similar imaging and diagnostic requirements, including dermatology, ophthalmology, and certain radiological applications. This expansion leverages the established computational network while extending market reach into new healthcare verticals.

### Go-to-Market Execution

BTT's go-to-market strategy balances direct provider engagement with strategic institutional partnerships to accelerate adoption across the fragmented healthcare landscape:

The provider acquisition strategy focuses on creating low-friction entry points for practices of all sizes. Small and medium practices can begin with minimal commitment through a pay-as-you-go model for basic diagnostic support, while larger institutions can deploy comprehensive solution suites with integrated tokenization and payment capabilities. Implementation support includes remote training, on-site technical assistance for equipment integration, and continuous performance monitoring to ensure positive outcomes.

Distribution channels combine direct engagement with technology integration through existing practice management systems and imaging equipment providers. By developing plug-in capabilities for widely used clinical software systems, BTT reduces implementation barriers and accelerates time-to-value for participating practices. Strategic partnerships with dental equipment manufacturers enable hardware-level integration that creates seamless workflows within existing clinical environments.

Educational initiatives form another critical component of market development, with BTT providing continuing education credits for dental professionals who complete training on AI-enhanced diagnostic protocols. These programs simultaneously improve clinical capabilities while increasing comfort with BTT's technological approach. Regular workshops, webinars, and regional user groups create community engagement that drives adoption through peer recommendation and shared experience.

A structured referral program incentivizes existing users to introduce BTT to colleagues, with rewards distributed in BTT tokens based on successful implementation and usage milestones. This program has proven particularly effective, currently generating 42% of new practice acquisitions through peer referral rather than direct marketing efforts.

## Tokenomics and Resource Allocation

The BTT token serves as the fundamental unit of value exchange within the ecosystem, designed with careful consideration of economic incentives, regulatory compliance, and sustainable growth. The tokenomics model balances the interests of all stakeholder groups while creating mechanisms for long-term ecosystem development and stability.

### Token Utility and Value Drivers

The BTT token incorporates multiple utility functions that drive intrinsic value through actual ecosystem usage rather than speculative interest. Primary utility functions include:

Computational resource payments for AI services, with healthcare providers using BTT to access diagnostic and analytical capabilities through the decentralized network. This creates continuous token velocity as providers purchase tokens for service access while compute contributors receive tokens for resource provision.

Governance participation rights that enable token holders to influence ecosystem development decisions, technical standards, and resource allocation priorities. This utility becomes increasingly valuable as the ecosystem matures and governance progressively decentralizes according to the established timeline.

Staking mechanisms for network security and prioritization, where token holders can stake BTT to secure preferential service levels, reduced fees, or enhanced features across the ecosystem's various components. This creates token demand from active ecosystem participants while reducing circulating supply.

Reward distribution for beneficial behaviors, including computational resource provision, patient health activities, ecosystem development contributions, and community governance participation. These reward mechanisms align economic incentives with activities that enhance overall ecosystem value.

Payment settlement across the healthcare value chain through the PayFi network, enabling near-instant transaction settlement with minimal fees compared to traditional payment rails. This utility creates natural token demand proportional to payment volume within the ecosystem.

### Token Allocation Structure

The total BTT token supply is fixed at 210 million tokens, distributed according to a balanced allocation structure that supports institutional stability while ensuring sufficient tokens for network operations and community growth.

| Allocation Category | Percentage | Tokens (millions) | Vesting Schedule | Purpose |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| China Oral Industry Group | 10% | 21.0 | 36-month linear vesting with 6-month cliff | Founding institution backing, industry access, initial capital |
| Vision Future Capital | 3% | 6.3 | 30-month linear vesting with 3-month cliff | Lead investor, healthcare tokenization expertise, Asian market access |
| Yueya Era Medical | 3% | 6.3 | 30-month linear vesting with 3-month cliff | Medical technology integration, healthcare provider connections |
| BellaSmile Group | 2% | 4.2 | 30-month linear vesting with 3-month cliff | Dental industry expertise, clinical implementation partner |
| Strategic Investors | 1% | 2.1 | 30-month linear vesting with 3-month cliff | Financial backing, strategic advisory, market development |
| Foundation & Technical Development | 17% | 35.7 | 48-month programmatic release tied to development milestones | Core protocol development, security audits, technical research |
| Mining Rewards Pool | 30% | 63.0 | Algorithmic distribution over 8 years based on computational contribution | Incentivizing AI computational resource provision |
| Community Incentives | 12% | 25.2 | Continuous distribution based on ecosystem participation | Patient health rewards, developer grants, adoption incentives |
| Ecosystem Growth Fund | 7% | 14.7 | Strategic release based on market development opportunities | Partnership development, exchange listings, regulatory compliance |

This allocation structure ensures that tokens are distributed to ecosystem participants based on value creation rather than speculation. The substantial mining rewards pool (30%) recognizes the critical importance of computational infrastructure to the ecosystem's functionality, while the balanced allocations to founding institutions (10%) and strategic investors (9% combined) provide essential backing while preventing excessive concentration of tokens.


### Mining Economics and Sustainability

The BTT mining model differentiates itself from traditional cryptocurrency mining through its focus on useful computation that delivers immediate healthcare value. This approach transforms computation from a purely consensus mechanism to a productive activity with tangible benefits beyond token generation.

Mining rewards are distributed according to a multi-variable formula that incorporates:

- Computational resources contributed (GPU capacity, specialized AI accelerators)
- Uptime and reliability metrics (consistent service availability)
- Quality of service parameters (low latency, high throughput)
- Geographic distribution factors (rewarding deployment in underserved areas)
- Energy efficiency metrics (incentivizing sustainable operations)

This comprehensive approach ensures that mining activities align with the ecosystem's core mission of improving healthcare accessibility and efficiency. Unlike traditional crypto mining that often consumes significant energy for artificial scarcity creation, BTT mining directs computational resources toward real-world healthcare applications with immediate clinical impact.

The economics of mining are deliberately structured to be accessible to a diverse range of participants, from individual contributors with modest equipment to institutional operators with sophisticated infrastructure. Initial data indicates positive economics across all scales:

- Home-scale miners (1-5 GPUs): 8-14% monthly return on investment
- Mid-scale operators (6-50 GPUs): 12-18% monthly return on investment
- Institutional infrastructure (50+ GPUs): 15-22% monthly return on investment

These economics ensure broad participation while creating natural market mechanisms that optimize resource allocation. As the network grows, these returns will normalize through market competition, but the fundamental value proposition of directing computational resources toward healthcare AI applications ensures sustained economic viability beyond initial adoption phases.

### Sustainable Growth Mechanisms

Beyond the initial token allocation, BTT incorporates multiple mechanisms to ensure long-term ecosystem growth and stability:

A portion of transaction fees from all ecosystem components is directed to the BTT Development Fund, creating sustainable funding for ongoing technical improvements, security audits, and infrastructure enhancements. This mechanism ensures that development resources scale proportionally with ecosystem activity.

Token burns from certain high-value transactions (particularly in the asset tokenization platform) gradually reduce total supply over time, creating deflationary pressure that benefits long-term ecosystem participants as adoption increases.

Staking incentives encourage token holders to lock tokens for extended periods in exchange for enhanced ecosystem benefits, reducing circulating supply while aligning participant interests with long-term ecosystem health. These staking mechanisms include governance weight multipliers, fee discounts, and priority service access.

Governance-controlled treasury provides flexibility to address emerging needs or opportunities without requiring additional token issuance. This treasury is initially managed by the Foundation with progressive transition to community governance according to the established decentralization timeline.

Collectively, these mechanisms create a self-sustaining economic model that balances current operational needs with long-term growth imperatives, ensuring that the BTT ecosystem can continue to expand its healthcare impact while maintaining economic stability for all participants.
