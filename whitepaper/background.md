# Background

## Introduction

The global healthcare and wellness industry is experiencing a paradigm shift, driven by the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Nowhere is this transformation more pronounced than in China’s oral health sector, where robust policy support, rapid market growth, and urgent demands for digital innovation are reshaping the landscape.

China Oral Industry Foundation (中国口腔产业基金会), together with partners such as Yueya Era (Digital Denture Processing), BellaSmile, Vision Future Capital, is pioneering this evolution. United by a mission to advance public health and industry modernization, these partners have launched the BitHive (BTT) Project—a next-generation Web3 initiative dedicated to the healthcare and oral wellness track. BitHive leverages blockchain, AI, DePIN hardware, RWA tokenization, and PayFi payment solutions to build an open, decentralized ecosystem for the future of health.

## Industry and Policy Landscape

China's oral health industry is in a phase of rapid expansion, fueled by strong government policy, rising consumer awareness, and increasing demand for high-quality healthcare services. National strategies such as the "Healthy China 2030" plan have elevated oral health to a core component of public health, driving significant investments in infrastructure, technology, and talent. According to recent market research, China's dental market was valued at US$ 7.68 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 13.95 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 6.86%[^6]. 

The Fourth National Oral Health Survey reveals encouraging signs of improved awareness, with 60.1% of the population now aware of the importance of oral care, and 84.9% maintaining a positive attitude toward oral health[^6]. The Healthy China 2030 Plan has set ambitious goals to raise awareness of oral health, encourage improved oral hygiene, and lower the rate of dental caries among 12-year-old children by an additional 10 to 25 percent in urban areas by 2030[^6].

Urbanization, higher living standards, and a growing focus on preventive care are accelerating the shift towards advanced, personalized dental services. This transformation is particularly evident in the rising demand for cosmetic dentistry among China's young and middle-class population, who are increasingly willing to invest in smile enhancement procedures such as teeth whitening, veneers, and orthodontics.

Despite this momentum, the industry faces persistent challenges: resource distribution remains highly uneven between urban and rural areas, data silos hinder collaboration, and the value chain lacks efficient, transparent mechanisms for asset transfer and incentive alignment. China's rapidly aging population presents both challenges and opportunities for the dental sector, with 254 million individuals aged 60 and over in 2019, projected to increase to 402 million (28% of the total population) by 2040[^6]. This demographic shift is driving increased demand for dental implants, dentures, and prosthetics as older patients seek both functional restoration and aesthetic improvement.

The need for digital transformation is acute—not only to improve service quality and accessibility but also to enable new business models such as AI-assisted diagnostics, smart manufacturing, and supply chain finance. Recent technological advancements, including 3D printing and innovative implant materials, have made treatments more effective and less invasive, with Chinese companies like UnionTech unveiling advanced dental 3D printing solutions in 2024[^6].

## The Role of China Oral Industry Group and Partners

As a recognized leader in the sector, China Oral Industry Group is driving digital transformation through strategic investments, mergers and acquisitions, and technology innovation. The group is building a comprehensive ecosystem that integrates research, clinical care, manufacturing, education, and finance, fostering collaboration across the entire value chain. By consolidating industry resources and promoting international cooperation, the group aims to establish China as a global hub for oral health innovation.

The China Oral Industry Foundation, together with partners such as Yueya Era Medical and BellaSmile, provides strong governance, funding, and cross-sector expertise to support large-scale, sustainable development. This alliance enables the BitHive (BTT) Project to mobilize industry assets, attract top talent, and accelerate the adoption of cutting-edge digital solutions.

## The BTT Vision

BitHive (BTT) is designed to address the industry’s most pressing needs by providing a unified, multi-layered protocol that connects healthcare, AI, DePIN mining, RWA, and payment infrastructure into a single, interoperable Web3 ecosystem. The project aims to:

- **Break down data and value silos** in the healthcare sector by enabling secure, permissioned data sharing and asset transfer across institutional and geographic boundaries.
- **Empower healthcare providers, patients, and innovators** with AI-driven tools, decentralized compute resources, and transparent incentive models.
- **Tokenize real-world healthcare assets** (such as medical equipment, infrastructure, and services) to unlock liquidity and enable new forms of investment and participation.
- **Integrate PayFi payment solutions** to bridge digital assets with real-world spending, supporting seamless healthcare payments and financial inclusion.

## Key Challenges and Opportunities

While the potential for blockchain and AI in healthcare is vast, several critical challenges must be addressed:

- **Interoperability:** Current healthcare and oral health systems are fragmented, with limited ability to share data and assets across platforms and borders.
- **Privacy and Security:** Sensitive health data requires robust privacy protections and compliance with global regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
- **Scalability:** Blockchain and DePIN solutions must support high transaction volumes and real-time processing for practical healthcare applications.
- **Adoption Barriers:** Healthcare stakeholders may face technical, regulatory, and cultural hurdles in adopting decentralized technologies.

BTT’s innovative architecture is purpose-built to overcome these obstacles, leveraging the combined expertise of its founding partners and the unique advantages of blockchain, AI, DePIN, RWA, and PayFi integration. By fostering collaboration across the healthcare and technology sectors, BitHive seeks to catalyze a new era of decentralized, intelligent, and inclusive health and wellness services—starting with oral health, but extending to the broader medical and wellness ecosystem in China and beyond.
