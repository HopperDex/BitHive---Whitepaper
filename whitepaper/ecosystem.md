## Ecosystem Value Flows

The BTT ecosystem creates a circular economy where value flows continuously between participants through four complementary mechanisms that collectively enhance the healthcare experience while generating sustainable economic value.

### Computational Resource Marketplace

At the core of BTT's technological infrastructure lies a sophisticated computational resource marketplace that elegantly bridges healthcare AI demand with decentralized computing supply. This marketplace operates through a seamless process where mining equipment operators contribute GPU and specialized AI accelerator compute resources to the network, creating a vast pool of computational capacity. BTT's intelligent resource allocation algorithm then orchestrates the distribution of computational tasks based on urgency, complexity, and resource availability, ensuring optimal utilization of the network's capabilities.

Contributors to this computational marketplace receive BTT tokens in proportion to their computational contribution, uptime, and quality of service, creating direct economic incentives for network participation and reliability. On the demand side, healthcare providers access these computational resources to power AI services such as diagnostic image analysis, treatment planning, and patient risk assessment, paying only for the specific resources consumed rather than maintaining expensive dedicated infrastructure.

This marketplace architecture fundamentally addresses a critical inefficiency in traditional computing models: the perpetual mismatch between computing supply and demand across time and location. By creating a dynamic, responsive market that adapts to fluctuating needs, BTT ensures computational resources are allocated precisely where they deliver maximum value, reducing waste while enhancing healthcare service delivery.

### Tokenized Asset Exchange

The BTT tokenized asset exchange represents a groundbreaking innovation in healthcare financing by creating unprecedented liquidity for traditionally illiquid healthcare assets. The process begins when healthcare providers register physical equipment, properties, service rights, or intellectual property for tokenization within the BTT ecosystem. These assets then undergo rigorous regulatory and technical verification processes to ensure compliance with all relevant regulations and technical standards for proper tokenization.

Following verification, digital tokens representing fractional ownership or usage rights are issued with transparent valuation models that reflect the underlying asset's true market value and potential future earnings. These tokens can then be traded on BTT's regulated exchange platform, allowing healthcare providers to access capital without divesting entirely from valuable assets while enabling investors to gain exposure to previously inaccessible healthcare infrastructure investments.

The real-world impact of this innovation is already substantial, with the exchange currently facilitating monthly transactions of ¥50 million in tokenized healthcare assets. Growth projections indicate this volume will expand tenfold to reach approximately ¥500 million in monthly transactions by 2027, demonstrating the significant untapped potential for tokenization in healthcare financing.

### Health Incentive System

The BTT health incentive system establishes a direct connection between positive health behaviors and tangible economic rewards, fundamentally realigning healthcare economic incentives toward prevention and ongoing wellness. The system begins when patients register health-promoting activities through authorized healthcare applications and connected services integrated with the BTT ecosystem. These activities span a wide spectrum from preventive care appointments to medication adherence and lifestyle improvements.

Each registered activity undergoes verification through multiple channels including trusted oracles, provider confirmations, or data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, ensuring the integrity of the incentive system. Once verified, BTT points are allocated to patients based on sophisticated algorithms that evaluate the activity's health value, potential impact on outcomes, and completion quality. These accumulated points offer genuine economic value as they can be exchanged for healthcare services, wellness products, or converted directly to BTT tokens for broader economic utility.

The effectiveness of this approach is confirmed by compelling data showing that patients engaged with the BTT incentive system demonstrate 39% higher preventive care compliance and 29% higher treatment plan completion rates compared to non-participants. These improved behaviors translate directly into better health outcomes and reduced long-term healthcare costs, creating value for all ecosystem participants.

### PayFi Payment Network

The BTT PayFi payment network serves as the critical bridge connecting the digital ecosystem with the physical healthcare economy, streamlining transactions while reducing friction and costs throughout the payment lifecycle.
