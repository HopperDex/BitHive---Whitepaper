### Mining Rewards Structure (30%)

The mining rewards pool forms the largest allocation, reflecting the critical importance of computational resources to the ecosystem's functionality. The distribution follows a declining emission schedule designed to incentivize early infrastructure contribution while ensuring sustainable long-term operations:

- Years 1-2: 25.2 million tokens (40% of mining allocation)
- Years 3-4: 18.9 million tokens (30% of mining allocation)
- Years 5-6: 12.6 million tokens (20% of mining allocation)
- Years 7-8: 6.3 million tokens (10% of mining allocation)

Mining rewards are distributed according to a multi-variable formula that incorporates computational contribution, service quality metrics, geographic distribution, and energy efficiency parameters. This approach ensures that rewards flow to participants providing the most valuable and sustainable computational resources rather than simply those with the most raw computing power.

## Token Release Schedule

The BTT token release follows a carefully designed schedule that balances immediate operational needs with long-term ecosystem stability:

| Year | Percentage Released | Cumulative Release | Primary Sources |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 2025 | 22% | 22% | Initial institutional allocations (partial), first mining rewards |
| 2026 | 18% | 40% | Continued mining rewards, vested institutional tokens, initial community incentives |
| 2027 | 15% | 55% | Accelerated community incentives, continued mining, foundation milestone releases |
| 2028 | 12% | 67% | Balanced distribution across all allocation categories |
| 2029 | 10% | 77% | Mining rewards, community incentives, strategic ecosystem fund deployment |
| 2030+ | 23% | 100% | Remaining mining rewards, final foundation milestone releases |

This progressive release schedule ensures sufficient token liquidity for ecosystem operations while preventing excessive early market supply. The timeline aligns with BTT's technical development roadmap, releasing tokens in conjunction with expanding utility and adoption to maintain economic balance.

## Sustainable Economic Mechanisms

Several complementary mechanisms ensure the long-term sustainability and value stability of the BTT token economy:

### Transaction Fee Structure
A portion of all ecosystem transaction fees (from computational marketplace, asset exchange, and payment processing) is redirected to the BTT Development Fund. This creates a sustainable funding source for ongoing development that scales organically with ecosystem activity, reducing reliance on initial token allocations over time.

### Deflationary Pressure
Strategic token burning mechanisms are implemented for high-value transactions within the ecosystem, particularly those related to asset tokenization and premium service access. This gradually reduces the circulating supply, creating mild deflationary pressure that benefits long-term ecosystem participants as adoption increases.

### Stake-to-Participate Models
Key ecosystem functions require staking BTT tokens, including computational resource verification, governance participation, and premium service access. These staking requirements temporarily remove tokens from circulation while encouraging alignment with long-term ecosystem health rather than short-term value extraction.

### Liquidity Management
The BTT Foundation actively manages token liquidity through strategic partnerships with regulated exchanges and DeFi protocols, ensuring sufficient market depth for legitimate ecosystem participants while discouraging excessive speculation. Liquidity management strategies include controlled token release during periods of unusual volatility and strategic deployment of ecosystem reserves.

### Value Accrual Mechanisms
The BTT token economy is designed to capture a portion of the value generated through efficiency improvements across the oral healthcare ecosystem. As computational resource costs decrease, asset liquidity improves, and payment friction reduces, a percentage of these efficiency gains flows back to token holders through reduced fees for token users and enhanced rewards for token stakers.

These interconnected economic mechanisms create a resilient token economy that balances immediate operational needs with long-term stability, ensuring that the BTT ecosystem can fulfill its mission of transforming oral healthcare accessibility and efficiency through the strategic integration of AI, DePIN infrastructure, asset tokenization, and streamlined payments.


## Token Utility and Value Drivers

The BTT token functions as the core economic unit within the BTT oral healthcare ecosystem, carefully designed to support the integration of AI diagnostics, DePIN mining infrastructure, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and PayFi payment solutions. The token's utility extends across multiple dimensions to create genuine value for all ecosystem participants.

### Computational Resource Exchange
BTT tokens serve as the primary medium for accessing and providing AI computational resources within the oral healthcare network. Dental clinics and healthcare providers use BTT to purchase computational resources for AI-driven diagnostic services, including panoramic image analysis, caries detection, orthodontic planning, and 3D modeling. This creates a continuous flow of tokens from service users to computational resource providers, establishing a sustainable economic loop that incentivizes infrastructure contribution.

### Asset Tokenization Mechanism
The BTT token enables the tokenization of valuable healthcare assets, transforming traditionally illiquid resources into tradable digital assets. Dental practices can tokenize equipment, property, intellectual property, and service rights, unlocking capital that would otherwise remain inaccessible. BTT tokens are required for initial tokenization processes, secondary market transactions, and enhanced liquidity services, creating utility-driven demand that grows proportionally with the ecosystem's tokenized asset base.

### Governance Rights
BTT token holders receive governance rights proportional to their holdings, allowing participation in critical ecosystem decisions. This includes voting on technical standards, resource allocation priorities, network upgrades, and strategic partnerships. The governance utility becomes increasingly valuable as the ecosystem progresses along its decentralization roadmap, transitioning from foundational institutional governance toward a more community-oriented model by 2028.

### Staking and Network Security
Token holders can stake BTT to enhance network security while receiving preferential treatment across ecosystem services. Staking options include computational resource prioritization, reduced fees on tokenized asset transactions, and enhanced participation in governance decisions. The staking mechanisms are designed to reduce circulating supply while aligning participant incentives with long-term ecosystem health rather than short-term speculation.

### Patient Incentive System
The BTT patient incentive system rewards beneficial healthcare behaviors with tokens, creating a direct economic incentive for preventive care, treatment adherence, and ongoing engagement. Patients can redeem earned tokens for services within the healthcare ecosystem or convert them to other value forms through the integrated PayFi network. This utility transforms healthcare engagement from a purely cost-centered activity to one with potential economic benefits.

### Payment Settlement
Through integration with the PayFi network, BTT tokens facilitate efficient payment settlement throughout the oral healthcare value chain. The token's settlement utility significantly reduces transaction costs and settlement times compared to traditional payment methods, particularly for cross-border transactions and micro-payments that would otherwise face prohibitive fees or delays.
